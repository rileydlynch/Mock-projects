This is a demo website which includes a MySQL database. The initial purpose was to demonstrate my ability to insert and withdraw data from a SQL database, effectively demonstrating my understanding of a website's backend. However, I have added additional functionality to this demo site to further demonstrate other technologies such as APIs. In order to test it for yourself, it's very simple, follow these steps:

1. Boot up your Node.js instance, clone this repository, and use *npm install* to install all of the packages.
2. In your MySQL database, create a database called "InstaBLAM" without the quotes. Then, run this SQL command:
> source Tables_and_Triggers.sql  

Then, exit sql and go back to the Node command prompt. You can do this by typing "exit" into the SQL command prompt.
3. At the Node prompt, input:
> node main_app.js

And your site will be live!
