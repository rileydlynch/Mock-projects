This is a demo website which includes a MySQL database. The initial purpose was to demonstrate my ability to insert and withdraw data from a SQL database, effectively demonstrating my understanding of a website's backend. However, I have added additional functionality to this demo site to further demonstrate other technologies such as APIs. In order to test it for yourself, it's very simple, follow these steps:

1. Boot up your Node.js instance, clone this repository, and use *npm install* to install all of the packages.
2. At the Node prompt, input:
> node Web_files/main_app.js
3. And your site will be live!
